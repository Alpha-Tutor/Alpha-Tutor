    <h1>Dress</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">My dress shines in the glimmery lights surrounding me. The flashes from the cameras were like little fireflies lighting up. Even though there were so many people here, watching me, I felt like I was alone in a forest in the dark just wearing my dress and feeling beautiful. I didnâ€™t even have to fake my big smile as I twirled and felt the dress swish and swish. When the cameras stopped and I was alone, still on the stage, I barely realized it. I wish I could go back to the forest where there were no worries and I had nothing to do but smile. I never wanted to take this dress off.
