    <h1> Treating a Wound</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story"> The most important thing about treating a new wound is cleaning the area and stopping the bleeding. If you don’t clean the wound before putting a bandaid on or covering it, it will become prone to infections. So it is important to wash your hands to prevent dirt from getting in the wound. Then, stop the bleeding. Press a tissue or gauze on the wound and hold it. Apply pressure and don’t let it go until the bleeding stops. Some small cuts or scrapes will sometimes stop on their own. After it stops bleeding, then wash the actual wound with clean water. Depending on how deep and serious the wound is, putting ointment on the wound can help it heal without a scar. For a simple cut, this is unnecessary. Finally, cover the wound with a bandaid or bigger gauze. This is the immediate process of treating a wound.</p> <p class="story1">
    Now after a while, it’s still important to change the covering and then (preferably once or twice a day). This ensures its cleanliness and reduces the risk of infections. If the wound is hurt again and begins to bleed again, then repeat this process. If it will not stop bleeding even with pressure pressing on to it, the wound might be deeper than you think and it is recommended to go to a doctor or get it checked out professionally. It is important not to leave the cut out in the air where it has a higher chance of infections and will take longer to heal. So follow these steps to ensure a faster, cleaner recovery from any cuts, scrapes, or small wounds!
