    <h1>The Tooth Fairy</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Yesterday I lost my first tooth. It hurt a lot but I knew it would be worth it. I fell asleep that day hopeful that the tooth fairy would visit me. I tucked my little tooth under my pillow. I had a dream that night that the tooth fairy sprinkled some pixie dust along with some coins and fluttered away. The very next day I jumped out of bed to see a big bag of chocolate coins.
