    <h1>Life of a Pencil</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="poem">I bought it from a shop,
      <br>
      A little old lady gave a dime,<br>
      I was put to work without a stop,<br>
      Every day I write the day and time.<br>
      I see my friends die and snap,<br>
      I was given to another kid,<br>
      I write stories and draw maps,<br>
      I lost and got a bid.<br><br>

      Every day I go through a machine,<br>
      It whirs and whirs and sharpens me,<br>
      I grow old and am no longer clean,<br>
      Little lead is left and I can barely see.<br><br>

      They say old people shrink,<br>
      I have shrunk too much,<br>
      I am tossed and I stink,<br>
      To my life, I still clutch.<br><br>

      Finally, I have retired,<br>
      The kids make fun and Iâ€™m thrown,<br>
      In the trash I am tired,<br>
      I cannot speak, nothing but a groan.<br>
    </p>
