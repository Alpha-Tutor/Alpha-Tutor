    <h1> The Night Storm</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story"> The rain pitter-pattered against the window. It was 3 in the night, everyone in my family was asleep and I woke up. It was banging against the window as I tossed and turned in bed already knowing that tonight was going to be a long night. It’s not common in Texas for it rains that often, but it was so random that even though it interrupted my sleep, I wish it would happen more often. My blinds were already open to show me the trees dancing with spirit in the breeze and the stars disappearing behind the mist. </p> <p class="story1">
    Thunder boomed as I shuddered and pulled the sheets closer. A streak of lightning split the sky in half with a bolt that shined brighter than the moon. Under the heavy blanket in my room, I felt comfort. I was awake for so long staring at the night sky, the darkness turned bright as morning came. The storm ended, leaving condensation on my windows and blurring them. The sleepless night had me waking up late and refreshed. The night storm was as special and rare as a diamond.
