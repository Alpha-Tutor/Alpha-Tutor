    <h1>A Trip to the Park</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Mat and Nick went to the park. They ran with their dog and had a picnic. They had bread, corn, and snacks. The grass was so green and the air was so nice, the flowers grew, and the birds chirped. Summer was coming after a long Winter’s snow. Their small puppy grew very tired and they looked at the sky. Soon it became dark, so they went back home and had a nap.
