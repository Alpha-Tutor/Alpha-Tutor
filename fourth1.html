    <h1>The Invention of a Light Bulb

    </h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">In the late 1800s, a man named Thomas Edison wanted to make a light bulb that could shine for a long time without burning out. He tried many different materials for the part of the bulb that lights up but they didn’t last very long. Finally, several years later, he found that using a piece of bamboo that was turned into carbon made the light bulb work for a long time. This was a big success after many tries with other materials that didn’t work.</p><p class="story1">
    Edison showed his new light bulb to people on New Year’s Eve in 1879 in New Jersey. Everyone was amazed by how bright and steady the light was. This invention made homes and streets safer and let people do things after dark without using candles or gas lamps. Edison’s light bulb helped start a new time when electricity became important in everyday life.
