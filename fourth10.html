    <h1>The Disappearing Garden</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="poem">I entered the garden with the fireflies glowing gold,<br>
      The grass bristled tickling my toes,<br>
      It came out of a scene from a fairytale told,<br>
      The beauty is unseen, nobody evens knows.<br><br>

      Then the moon started shining,<br>
      The birds began rhyming,<br>
      The stars started lining,<br>
      And the foxes began climbing.<br><br>

      The wind whistled in the breeze,<br>
      The squirrels gnawed at the trees,<br>
      The dirt settled in a tease,<br>
      And I got weak in the knees.<br><br>

      A wolf howled in the distance,<br>
      The owls echoed in persistence,<br>
      The moon dawns with resistance,<br>
      And the critters hide from existence.<br><br>

      The leaves fall to the ground,<br>
      Deceased into mounds,<br>
      The Sun comes around,<br>
      All feeling was never to be found.<br><br>

      The trees crumble in a twister,<br>
      My face melted like a sifter,<br>
      It happened, couldn’t be crisper,<br>
      And everything vanishes in a whisper.
