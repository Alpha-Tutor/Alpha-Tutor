    <h1>Chocolate</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Chocolates are a universal favorite candy and are so sweet and popular they have expanded to being sold in different shapes and styles. There is white chocolate, the sweetest, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate, the most bitter. Many people don’t know that chocolate comes from a bean called the cacao bean. Cacao beans are sometimes bitter so white chocolate has more sugar in it and dark chocolate is crushed cacao beans with less sugar. The cacao tree is native to the Amazon Basin in South America and has then been taken to Central America and other places to be grown. Although chocolate is known for being unhealthy and sweet, dark chocolate is the healthiest and in moderation, it’s okay to eat!
