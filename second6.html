    <h1>The Sun's Dream</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">When I grew up I have always dreamed about being an astronaut who would look at the sun up close. I would be the first person who could feel the sun's glowing light. I would be like the first person who touched the moon. Waving the flag of my country in the sun. The sun is a big yellow, glowing ball of sunshine. I adore the way that it never loses its energy or power. The sun always powers through the darkness in space, always shining its amazing light. That is why I dream one day I will become an astronaut who can feel the sun's rays up close.
