    <h1>Hike</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Last week, my friends and I went camping and I went on a hike. It was so much fun in the woods. There were a lot of trees and plants. There were bugs too. We made a snack so we could eat on the hike. When we came back home, we were very dirty. We cleaned up and it was the best hike ever.
