    <h1> 
      My First Plane Ride
    </h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story"> I am finally going on my first plane ride to my home country, Italy! I explained to my friends how this is my first ride even though I am almost ten and they told me that this is going to be the best experience of my life. An experience that I will never forget! I live in Canada so I have about nine hours on the plane. My parents are even letting me have the window seat! “Eliana, they’re calling us, let’s go inside!” my dad calls. We’re finally going! My family left early to the airport just in case and we have been going through security, buying snacks, and just sitting around for what feels like a thousand hours! I roll my suitcase across the carpet and go through the ramp. I want to run down the ramp so badly, but it isn’t safe and there are many people around us. So I patiently walk down and when we finally make it to the plane, an air hostess greets us with a smile. I grin back and thank her! We walk a little bit further and my dad helps me put my suitcase on the above compartments on top of the seats. We are in the front of the plane where there are many people and there are three people who sit together. I am going to sit in the window seat with my parents next to me. </p>
    <p class = "story1"> After everyone settled into their seats, there was a long announcement about the safety features on the plane, which I listened to patiently just in case anything happened during the ride, but the plane was very safe. Finally, another announcement rang. “Prepare for takeoff!”</p> <p class="story1">
    The plane flew steadily to the sky. My parents kept their heads down and closed their eyes for comfort, but I didn’t understand why! I was looking out the window watching the world get bigger and bigger, making everything look smaller and smaller. The houses became specs, buildings became dots, and acres cut into tiny squares, until everything blended in the distance. Since when was the world so big?? The sky met my gaze as clouds enveloped the plain. The plane's wing and out position in the sky appeared to be still, unmoving. But I knew that we were moving crazy fast, like when you see a plane flying in the sky above you. My friends were right, this was the experience of my life.
