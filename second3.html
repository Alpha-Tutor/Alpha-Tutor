    <h1>Maps</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Maps are very important for seeing where different places are and how to get there. They can be used when learning about different countries, traveling, and making sense of where different places are. On the edge of some maps are keys or legends which show the meaning of some symbols. For example, if there is a triangle between two countries, in the key, it might say that triangles represent forests. In classes for geography (the study of places) maps are used. There are different types of maps to show different things too.
