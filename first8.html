    <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">The dinosaurs gathered in their weekly meeting. They had heard about another dinosaur that would come into their village and save them. The dinosaurs knew that with no more food, they would live for longer. Then Jack Dinosaur came into the village with a big mango plant. All the dinosaurs gathered around the very big mango plant.  They started plucking mangoes from the tree and their hungry stomachs got filled.
