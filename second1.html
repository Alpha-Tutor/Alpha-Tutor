    <h1>Technology</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Technology has many good and bad things about it. Some good things are its ability to make learning easier and more resources accessible. You can be entertained by watching your favorite shows, communicating with family or friends, and playing games. Technology can also be bad for you if you overuse it. You can sometimes stop doing simple things like playing outside and talking to more people in person, and many kids would prefer watching television instead of reading. Although technology is very important, make sure you limit technology use.
