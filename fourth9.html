    <h1> Calm Down</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="poem"> When the world feels big and loud,<br>
      Take a breath, be calm and proud.<br>
      Close your eyes, let worries drift away,<br>
      Find a quiet place where you can stay.<br><br>

      Imagine a peaceful, gentle stream,<br>
      Where worries flow and lose their gleam.<br>
      Feel your body relax, your mind unwind,<br>
      As calmness fills you, the peace you find.<br><br>

      Picture a sunny, tranquil day,<br>
      Where clouds of stress just float away.<br>
      Breathe in slowly, breathe out slowly,<br>
      Let your inner calmness grow.<br><br>

      In your mind, find a cozy space,<br>
      Where worries vanish without a trace.<br>
      Think of happy times and laughter's sound,<br>
      Let joy and peace wrap all around.<br><br>

      Count to four as you breathe in deep,<br>
      Let calmness in, let worries seep.<br>
      Know that peace is always near,<br>
      In your heart, it will appear.<br><br>

      With each breath, feel the tension ease,<br>
      Embrace the calm, let worries cease.<br>
      You're in control, you're strong and wise,<br>
      Calmness surrounds you, reaching the skies.
