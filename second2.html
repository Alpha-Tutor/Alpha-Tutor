    <h1>Instruments</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Many different types of instruments can create music. For example, some common instruments are the piano, violin, guitar, drums, and many more. Instruments are usually separated by category based on how they were made, how they look, and how their sounds are made. The four common groups are string instruments, woodwind instruments, brass instruments, and percussion. String instruments would be the instruments that need strings to make sound. In this, there would be harps, violins, cellos, and guitars, and those are just to name a few.
