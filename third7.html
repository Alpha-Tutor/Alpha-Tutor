    <h1>Santa Comes to Town</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">I could barely sleep the night before Christmas. Emmy was snoring next to me but I had tried my best to stay awake just in case Santa came up to my room! I gave him a long list- but not too long- I asked for a pony, some new headbands, and a new bicycle. Mom said that was way too much to ask, but even if I get one, that would be okay. I jumped out of bed and shook Emmy awake, she was such a sleepyhead. We ran downstairs to see the Christmas tree surrounded by four gifts. I had given one to Emmy and she gave one to me. And our parents had given both of us one. I opened my gifts to find some new headbands from my parents and a toy pony from my sister Emmy. This was the best Christmas ever!
