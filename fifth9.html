    <hr>
    <p class="story"> “Ding!” The bell rang as a new customer entered my family’s pizzeria. The familiar face exclaimed when he saw my father and mother welcoming him with open arms and wide smiles. “Hey, brother, good to see you, how’s business? Booming?” Mr. Alonzo asked my parents. My mother replied, “Oh stop Alonzo, it’s thanks to you and all these family members sitting here today!” “Of course you would say that Mary, anyways, I’m going to have a classic Cheese Mozzarella and a Veggie Pizza--” he was interrupted as my parents said in unison, “With extra parmesan!” They erupted in laughter as my parents returned to the kitchen where my brother and I stood. “Hey kiddos, Mr. Alonzo would like his usual.” my father told us. Most of our customers were regulars so at this point, after years of business at the “People’s Pizzeria” we knew most of their orders. </p> <p class="story1">
    My brother Elias and I went to the back of the kitchen to prepare the dough for Mr. Alonzo’s pizza. We even had our little system for making the pizza, we were the best little helpers according to most of the customers. “Your two boys are going to be the legacy of this Pizzeria, you guys are in good hands!” a customer once said. But as I watch the customers bond with my parents, and my brother making the pizza we’re working on with so much love and passion, I feel so out of place. Since I was a little kid, I always worked here every weekend and after school, it was always so fun to spend time with my family, but in school, we’re learning more and spreading our bandwidth. Lately, I’ve been studying more about Medicine in school for a project. I feel so passionately about the topic and I really want to save lives. I’m not sure if my parents will be supportive of my passion for Medicine and how I want to grow up to work in that field instead of taking over the Pizzeria. But I will conquer my fears and do what I love!
