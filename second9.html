    <h1>Seed to Forest</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="poem">A seed waited in the dirt to grow,
      <br>
      Rain watered and helped it more,
      <br>
      The soil made it healthy enough to glow,
      <br>
      Then the seed sprouted and through the grass it tore.
      <br>
      <br>

      It became a plant that reached for the sun,
      <br>
      With constant attention, it would rise,
      <br>
      It grew slow, took its time, didnâ€™t run,
      <br>
      Its roots grew, forming bonds and ties.
      <br><br>

      It became a tree with a solid trunk,
      <br>
      It had roots that spread acres through the land,
      <br>
      It had wide branches and a base that sunk,
      <br>
      All by itself and nature, no help from a human hand.
      <br><br>

      It dropped its seeds and gave more trees,
      <br>
      Trees would grow around it, roots locking,
      <br>
      It became a forest bigger than the seas,
      <br>
      Together they grow, walking and talking.
    </p>
