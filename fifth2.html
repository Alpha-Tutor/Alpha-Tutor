    <h1> Typing Treasure</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story"> Typing is an admirable skill, nowadays with the accessible technology, typing has become a daily task that can sometimes replace writing with a pen or pencil. However, if you are fluent in the language you type in, take a second to note how fast you can type without even looking at the keyboard. Many of us type so often that we have developed a muscle memory for where each key is and our fingers move automatically. Especially easy words like “the,” or “and,” you can try to even close your eyes and you will still be able to type the word in a second without doubt. Even as I’m typing this passage, instead of focusing on the keys I click, I focus on the computer to make sure the spelling and appearance are correct. However, many people have to look at the keys to know what they are typing. When typing without looking, you can type faster and more accurately. That is why, the upcoming generations should work hard to practice typing without looking. </p> <p class="story1">
    There are many different websites and learning apps to help you practice typing fast and with more accuracy. There are even classes in some schools that work on typing and test your ability. Your ability to type can also be more appealing to jobs that involve coding or writing. Your keyboard is also specialized to make it easier to type without seeing too. For example, if you look at your “F” and “J” keys, there is a little bump on them so you immediately know to put your index fingers on those keys and adjust your other fingers to cover more keyboard area. There are also two shift keys on a normal keyboard so that it is faster to capitalize your sentences with both your left and right hand. Next time you have a typing assignment, remember the benefits of typing practices and typing treasures!
