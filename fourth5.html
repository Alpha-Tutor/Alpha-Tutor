    <h1> A Birthday Wish</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story"> In a quiet town with hills and trees all around, Lily celebrated her tenth birthday. She had a cake with ten candles glowing brightly. Lily closed her eyes and made a wish before blowing out the candles. She wished for a magical adventure where she could fly like a bird and meet friendly dragons who told stories from long ago.</p><p class="story1">
    When Lily blew out the candles, a gentle breeze filled the room, carrying a touch of magic. Later that night, as she lay in bed with the moonlight shining in, something amazing happened. Her room filled with a soft glow, and outside her window, a big dragon flew across the sky full of stars. Lily couldn't believe her eyesâ€”her wish had come true! She whispered a promise to keep this magical world a secret, feeling thankful to the stars for giving her the best birthday gift ever.
