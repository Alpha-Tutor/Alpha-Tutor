    <h1> Constellations</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="poem"> Orion is a hunter,
      <br>
      With three stars in a line,
      <br>
      Leo is a lion,
      <br>
      In the shape of a backwards question mark.
      <br><br>


      Aries is a ram,<br>
      With stars shaped in a “V”
      <br>
      Scorpius is a scorpion,
      <br>
      The brightest in the sky.
      <br><br>

      Aquarius is a water bearer, 
      <br>
      Shaped like a jar,
      <br>
      Pegasus is a horse,
      <br>
      With the shape of its frame.<br><br>

      Ursa Minor, Ursa Major,<br>
      Little Dipper, Big Dipper,,<br>
      Two bears crawling around,
      <br>
      In the sky, lost and found.
      <br><br>

      Corona Borealis is a crown,
      <br>
      Called the Blaze Star,
      <br>
      Shown in spring and summer,
      <br>
      Shaped like an upside down arc.
      <br><br>

      Constellations are found in the sky,<br>
      Made up of stars that appear smaller than your eye,<br>
      Though some are bigger than the Sun, they are too far, too high,<br>
      In different patterns, they lie.
