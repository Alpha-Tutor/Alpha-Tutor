    <hr>
    <p class="poem"> When I walked through, I fell,<br>
      Into a void, I couldnâ€™t tell,<br>
      Then I dropped, the sound of a bell,<br>
      I realized I was under a spell.    <br><br>


      The room was empty and dark,<br>
      As I walked I felt a spark,<br>
      I looked at my hand and saw a mark,<br>
      Then my arm transformed into bark.<br><br>

      I turned frozen and grew still,<br>
      I was so scared and could feel a thrill,<br>
      There was a scream, it was shrill,<br>
      I fell to the ground and felt a chill.<br><br>

      The room rotated and shook,<br>
      Then it dangled like under a hook,<br>
      I heard fluttering, like from a book,<br>
      And then it settled with one look.<br><br>

      Then snow fell from the sky,<br>
      Like a snowglobe, it will fly,<br>
      Sneaking up on me like a spy,<br>
      Then something emerged from the ground, thick like dye.<br><br>

      There was liquid, millions of feet deep,<br>
      I fell through it and let it seep,<br>
      All I wanted to do was sleep,<br>
      When I woke up, I was in bed lying in a heap.
