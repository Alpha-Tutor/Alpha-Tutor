    <h1>Reading</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Reading is one of the most popular activities to do when bored, wanting entertainment, or gaining information. There are many different genres to read that can appeal to different people. First, there are fictional and nonfictional. Nonfiction is used to inform, persuade, or sometimes entertain. It is purely factual and read for research purposes or if you want to learn new things. Fiction has a broader scale of genres, such as historical fiction, realistic fiction, romance, mystery, horror, and many more. Libraries usually section books by nonfiction/fiction, age, and genres. In libraries, there are also many audiobooks for those who prefer listening to someone else reading. Overall reading has been an old hobby that will probably stay for a long time.
