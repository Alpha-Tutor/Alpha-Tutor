    <h1>Unicorn?</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">“Guys come out right now you won't believe what my horse turned into” I shouted  “Why is your horse growing a horn? '' Jesse exclaimed. “I think… I think my horse is turning into a unicorn. If it is then I would be able to fly with it and the best part is that it could talk” I exclaimed. Then my unicorn started speaking. She said these very words “Hello Grace, I have been waiting to speak to you for a while and you are finally ready to go on this adventure with me?” “Yes!” I exclaimed as I jumped onto the unicorn and my adventure awaited me!
