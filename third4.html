    <h1>When Facing a Bear!</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">When facing a bear, many would think to run away or even try to fight it with whatever’s nearby, but bears are one of the most deadly animals and if it spots you and is hungry, you can get injured badly. What you have to do is stand still and don’t move. Stand your ground and make it known that you are not trying to hurt it. Only if it thinks you are a danger, will it try to attack you. If you slowly retreat backwards then it should leave you alone. Avoid loud noises and very noticeable gestures. If it continues to walk toward you, lay on the ground, and pretend to be dead. If it thinks you are dead, then it will go away. It’s also a good idea to bring bear spray to protect yourself if you are going to the mountains. Good luck next time you see a bear!
