    <h1>Snowy Days</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">As I left my house to walk to school I felt a snowflake at the tip of my nose. I looked up at the blinding white sky and tiny white flicks started falling. I stuck my tongue out, catching another one. It tasted like cold water that stuck with me for the rest of the day. The snow started falling slowly but by the time I was halfway to my school, it was already two inches on the ground. Small, neat, footprints trailed behind me as I reached school. I said bye to the snow but even throughout school I stared past the windows and watched. When I went home, I would play.
