    <h1>Sing</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">I love to sing and today I will sing in front of my school. I am very scared but happy too! I am singing with my friends so it will be fun. We are singing in front of many kids, but my friends who are listening to us will love it. After we sing, we will eat ice cream and have even more fun!
