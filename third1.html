    <h1>Animals</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">There are thousands and thousands of different animals on Earth including humans. Different types of animals can be separated by their habitat, bone structure, and survival traits. For example, there are herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores. Herbivores only eat plants like giraffes, omnivores eat both plants and other animals like bears, and carnivores only eat other animals like sharks. Most animals have emerged from other types of animals like two different species combined. These are called hybrids such as a zebra and a horseâ€™s child would be called a zorse. Although humans are one of the most complex animals there are, it is important to remember there are animals that live in the sky, the oceans, and even underground.
