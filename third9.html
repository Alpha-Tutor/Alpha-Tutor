    <h1>Art</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="poem">Art is an expression,
      <br>
      A statement or a question,     <br>
      Art is a passion,     <br>
      For drawing or fashion.     <br>     <br>

      Art is a story,     <br>
      To be told is a glory,     <br>
      A poem or a book,     <br>
      With meaning or just a look.     <br>     <br>

      Art is infinite,     <br>
      It is imperfect, doesn’t have to fit,     <br>
      Art is nature, everywhere,     <br>
      It is as rare as air.     <br>     <br>

      Art is a person,     <br>
      To better or to worsen,     <br>
      Art is abstract or real,     <br>
      It depends on the person to appeal.     <br>     <br>

      Art can be made by anyone,     <br>
      It can be lost or it can be done,     <br>
      Whether it’s ugly or pretty,     <br>
      Or it’s left in the dirt to pity.
