    <h1> A Clock’s Worth</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story"> Sometimes when I go outside and play with my friends, time passes like seconds. And sometimes when I am sitting in my least favorite class in school, the time passes like hours. I feel as though I am being forced to watch paint dry on the walls. But all along, the clock goes “tick, tock” by the second, minute, and hour, and the days pass as they would no matter whether I am on a vacation near the beach, or locked in a room. Often, I feel like when having fun, time runs away from me, and when not having fun, the time drags out.</p><p class="story1">
    Today I was in my math class, my favorite class, and the usual one-hour class felt like just thirty minutes. My best friend felt as if it was two hours, their least favorite class in math. Time is often subjective like this, so it’s important to keep watch. When I’m watching television before a class, sometimes I’m so involved in the show that I forget about class and am late. I always make sure to watch the clock from now on to never be early or late!
