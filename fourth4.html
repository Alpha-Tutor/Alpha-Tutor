    <h1>Jane Goodall</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Jane Goodall is a scientist who loves animals. She was born in London, England, in 1934. When she was a young woman, Jane went to Africa to study chimpanzees. She watched them every day, quietly sitting and taking notes. Jane discovered that chimpanzees are smartâ€”they use tools like sticks to find food. This was a big surprise because people used to think only humans could do things like that.</p><p class="story1">
    Jane's discoveries changed how we understand chimpanzees. She showed that they have feelings and families, just like us. Jane started the Jane Goodall Institute to help protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She wants everyone to care for animals and nature. Jane Goodall is still helping animals and teaching people about the importance of protecting our planet today. Her work reminds us that we are all connected to nature and need to take care of it.
