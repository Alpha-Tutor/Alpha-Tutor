    <h1> Park Picnic</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">I went on a picnic with my mom, dad, and sister. We all went to a park and played with our dog, Sam. Sam loves to play and run with me and my sister. My mom will read and my dad will sleep in the grass. We play music and have fun in the sun. There are many bugs in the grass too but we still have fun.
