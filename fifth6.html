    <h1> The Talking Parrot</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story"> “Squawk! Squawk!” Ellie’s new parrot was so excited to be welcomed to its new family. Ellie brought her new parrot to the living room and set it in its cage. “Hi Trinity, this is going to be your new home, I’m going to teach you different tricks!” Ellie exclaimed. “Hi Trinity, squawk, hi Trinity!” Trinity said her first words and Ellie ran to her mom and dad telling them what happened. So her parents and she went to confront Trinity but Trinity only squawked back when Ellie asked her for her name.</p> <p class="story1">
    Every time Ellie asked Trinity to speak again when they were alone, the parrot would always reply and even start to speak full sentences, but whenever other people were around, Trinity would only squawk. So Ellie decided to record what Trinity was saying so her parents would finally believe her. When the time came and Trinity was speaking, Ellie took out her phone and began recording the parrot. “Hi, I’m Trinity, I’m a parrot, I’m learning to speak, Squawk!” Ellie stopped recording and set her phone down to bring a treat for her parrot. But when she came back with a cup of milk and some parrot food, the cage was open and Trinity and her phone were gone! She yelled for the parrot to come and search her house all around. Finally, when she went back to the living room, Trinity was back in her cage, her cage locked, and her phone sitting where she left it. But when she checked her phone, the recording was gone. Trinity squawked “Hi Trinity, I love to speak, I’m Trinity, I only talk to Ellie, Ellie and Trinity!” Ellie asked Trinity, “Do you not like anyone to hear you talk except me, Trinity?” “Squawk,” Trinity began, “I’m Trinity, yes, Ellie is correct!” From then on, Trinity decided to let the parrot feel comfortable speaking wherever it wanted and until she was ready, she would never trick or force her into anything again.
