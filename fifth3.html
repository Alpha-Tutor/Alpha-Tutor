    <h1> 
      Helen Keller
    </h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story"> Helen Keller was an American author, an advocate for people with disabilities, and a very popular activist. Growing up, Helen Keller was blind, deaf, and mute. Without the ability to see, hear, or speak, she still managed to learn how to read and write and eventually became a lecturer. She was trained to read Braille, a book with texture to make it easier for blind people to read. She then learned sign language and began to communicate. As she grew up, she developed the ability to speak. After working hard to write and read, she began speaking her words and became a lecturer and activist. She helped fight for women’s rights and peace movements. Later in her life, she founded Helen Keller International, a health charity that provides for people with disabilities globally. </p> <p class="story1">
    Although Helen Keller was not born with three of our most used senses, with the help of her instructor and lifelong best friend, Anne Sullivan, she was able to do wonders. Anne Sullivan started mentoring Keller at an elementary age and even taught her the first word she spoke. “Water” was the first thing Helen Keller spoke after Sullivan placed Keller’s hand under a water pump. This method of using your touch sense was how Keller was able to connect work to an item. She died a successful, revolutionary woman and this is a famous quote of hers.
    “The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched – they must be felt with the heart.” - Helen Keller
