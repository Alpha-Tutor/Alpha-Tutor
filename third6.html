    <h1>The Haunted House</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Alex and Benny were going to the biggest Haunted House in the entire neighborhood for Halloween. They had been waiting for what felt like ages to go here and finally, their parents agreed to let them go. They had been warned that it would be scary, but at this point, the boys were ready for anything. They entered confident, they would not leave until going through the entire house. They first encountered a maze where occasionally a ghost would appear. Then they went through a tunnel that was filled with slime. After that, there was an upside-down room where they fought against gravity. Finally, they had to beat a final boss, zombie-geddon. Alex would hide and go to the door across from them, while Benny fought them off. They finally won and proved all of their friends wrong by going through the impossible Haunted House!
