    <h1>Seasons</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">There are four seasons; Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Spring is usually at the beginning of the year in the first few months, it is when new life comes such as new flowers blooming and animals coming out of hibernation. Then is Summer which is when most schools are having a break. This is the hottest season and usually happens in the early middle of the year. After Summer, is Fall (or sometimes called Autumn). Fall is when the leaves change colors and it can sometimes be rainy. Lastly, there is Winter which is the coldest season at the end of year.
