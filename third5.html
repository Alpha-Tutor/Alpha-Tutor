    <h1>An Infinite Loop</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">I wake up to a bird pecking at my leg. Accidentally, I jerk it away, scaring the bird away, and hear leaves crunching under me. “Come back birdie!” I called out. But instead, I hear the echoes of my voice infinite. Standing up, I see the bird staring right at me, its eyes enlarging and it grows the size of an airplane. I run as fast as my feet can take me but I feel like I’m in a loop, passing the same gold rock every minute. I decided to give up and turn to the bird still chasing me. I try to climb on it but as soon as I touch it, it disappears and the sky suddenly turns from bright blue to black. Some force like air pushes me down against the ground and the ground starts to absorb me. I sink beneath the dirt and after what feels like forever I wake up to a bird pecking at my leg.
