    <h1>Princess Dream</h1>

    <hr>
    <p class="story">Once upon a time, there was a young girl who dreamed she was a princess. Every night she slept dreaming about a shiny tiara on her head. One night as she slept, a tiara floated down slowly on her head. She was in a big, poofy princess dress too! She waved to her kingdom. She never wanted to leave her castle. It was everything she ever wanted.
